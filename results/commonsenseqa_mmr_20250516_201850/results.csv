commonsenseqa,mmr,commonsenseqa_dev_951,"Working on the elaborate task was taxing, it require extreme what?
A. holding
B. concentration
C. energy
D. job
E. energh",B. concentration,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

""Working on the elaborate task was taxing, it require extreme what?""

Step 1: Understand the context
- The task is elaborate and taxing, meaning it is complex and demanding.
- The word ""taxing"" suggests that the task requires a lot of mental or physical effort.

Step 2: Look at the options
A. holding
B. concentration
C. energy
D. job
E. energh (likely a typo for ""energy"")

Step 3: Evaluate each option
- ""holding"" doesn't fit well with the context of a taxing task.
- ""concentration"" makes sense because complex tasks often require intense focus.
- ""energy"" also makes sense because demanding tasks require physical or mental energy.
- ""job"" is too general and doesn't specify what is required.
- ""energh"" appears to be a typo; assuming it means ""energy,"" it is similar to option C.

Step 4: Determine the best fit
- The phrase ""extreme what"" suggests a noun that can be modified by ""extreme.""
- ""concentration"" fits naturally: ""extreme concentration.""
- ""energy"" also fits: ""extreme energy,"" but ""extreme concentration"" is a more common collocation when describing taxing mental tasks.

Step 5: Final decision
- Given the context of an elaborate, taxing task, ""concentration"" is the most appropriate and common choice.

Final answer: B. concentration

A. newness
B. loss of innocence
C. enlightenment
D. open mind
E. smartness",D. open mind,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

**Question:** When learning about the world and different cultures, what is important if you are committed to eliminating preconceived notions?

**Step 1:** Understand the key parts of the question.
- The focus is on learning about the world and different cultures.
- The goal is to eliminate preconceived notions, which suggests openness and avoiding biases.

**Step 2:** Consider the options:
A. newness – suggests freshness or novelty, but not directly related to eliminating preconceived notions.
B. loss of innocence – implies becoming less naive, but not necessarily about eliminating biases.
C. enlightenment – refers to gaining insight or understanding, but not specifically about openness.
D. open mind – directly relates to being receptive to new ideas and eliminating biases.
E. smartness – general intelligence, not specifically about eliminating preconceived notions.

**Step 3:** Match the options to the goal.
- To eliminate preconceived notions, having an open mind is essential because it allows one to consider new perspectives without bias.

**Step 4:** Conclusion.
- The most appropriate answer is **D. open mind**.

**Final answer:** D. open mind

commonsenseqa,mmr,commonsenseqa_dev_1141,"What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?
A. die
B. interruption
C. bleed
D. hatred
E. dying",B. interruption,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

**Question:** What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?

**Options:**
A. die  
B. interruption  
C. bleed  
D. hatred  
E. dying

**Step 1: Understand the question.**  
The question asks: ""What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?""  
This implies that the outcome is that the attempt did not succeed.

**Step 2: Consider each option in context.**  
- **A. die:** If someone dies, the attempt was successful, not unsuccessful. So this is unlikely.
- **B. interruption:** If the attempt is interrupted, it remains unsuccessful. This makes sense.
- **C. bleed:** Bleeding could be part of an attempt, but bleeding alone doesn't necessarily determine success or failure.
- **D. hatred:** Hatred is an emotion, not a direct result of the attempt's success or failure.
- **E. dying:** Similar to 'die,' if the person dies, the attempt was successful.

**Step 3: Determine the most logical answer.**  
The key is ""unsuccessful attempt,"" meaning the person did not die. The most direct outcome indicating failure is that the attempt was interrupted or prevented.

**Step 4: Choose the best fit.**  
""Interruption"" directly suggests that the attempt was stopped before success, making it unsuccessful.

**Final reasoning:**  
The best answer is **B. interruption** because it directly indicates that the attempt did not succeed.

**Question:** Everybody seemed to be crying at the holy site, the tour guide explained that this was what?

**Options:**
A. profane  
B. halibut  
C. damaged  
D. common  
E. halibut

---

**Step 1: Understand the context**

- People are crying at a holy site.
- The tour guide explains that this crying is ""what?""

**Step 2: Consider the options**

- **A. profane:** means disrespectful or irreverent, which doesn't relate to crying.
- **B. halibut:** a type of fish, irrelevant in this context.
- **C. damaged:** could relate to something broken, but not directly to crying.
- **D. common:** suggests that crying at this site is normal or usual.
- **E. halibut:** repeated, again irrelevant.

**Step 3: Logical reasoning**

- Crying at a holy site could be a common or expected emotional response, especially in religious or spiritual contexts.
- The phrase ""this was what?"" suggests the tour guide is explaining the reason or nature of the crying.

**Step 4: Best fit**

- The most logical and contextually appropriate answer is **D. common**, implying that crying at this holy site is a common occurrence.

---

**Final step:** The reasoning aligns with the idea that crying at a holy site is a typical or common behavior, so the best answer is **D. common**.

**Question:** The painter started to edge the room with tape, he always took extra care to make the lines clean and crisp when working with an what?

**Options:**
A. triangle  
B. middle  
C. corner  
D. center  
E. interior

**Step 1: Understand the context**  
The painter is edging the room with tape, which is a common painting technique to create clean lines along edges, especially at corners or borders.

**Step 2: Identify what the painter is working with**  
The key phrase is ""to make the lines clean and crisp."" When painting a room, painters often use painter's tape to mask off areas to ensure straight, clean lines.

**Step 3: Consider each option**  
- **A. triangle:** Not directly relevant; a triangle isn't a typical part of painting edges.  
- **B. middle:** The middle of a wall or room isn't where tape is usually applied for edging.  
- **C. corner:** Edging along corners is common, and tape is often used to get crisp lines at corners.  
- **D. center:** Not relevant; the center of a room isn't associated with edging with tape.  
- **E. interior:** The interior of a room is broad; while painting occurs there, it doesn't specify the part where tape is used for crisp lines.

**Step 4: Logical deduction**  
The phrase ""working with an"" suggests the object or area involved in creating the clean lines. The most specific and relevant option is **""corner""**, because painters often use tape to ensure crisp lines at corners.

**Step 5: Final reasoning**  
Since the question emphasizes ""edges"" and ""lines,"" and the common painting practice involves taping along corners to achieve clean lines, the best fit is **""corner""**.

### **Final answer: C. corner**
