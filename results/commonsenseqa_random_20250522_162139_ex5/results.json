    "expected_answer": "B. concentration",
    "response": "This question is about the difficulty and intensity of a task. The phrase \"working on the elaborate task was taxing\" suggests that the task was mentally or physically demanding. The word \"extreme\" implies a high level of effort or intensity. Among the options, \"concentration\" and \"energy\" are directly related to the mental and physical effort required for a taxing task. However, since the task is described as elaborate, concentration is likely the key factor needed to complete it successfully. Therefore, the answer is B. concentration.\nAnswer: B. concentration",

Second, individuals who are dying may be unable to work due to their health condition, making them eligible for social security payments. Third, options like rejuvenation, born again, no longer exist, and change of color do not relate to the eligibility criteria for social security payments. Therefore, the answer is D. unable to work.\nAnswer: D. unable to work",

    "response": "This question is about the necessary attire for hiking. The options provided do not directly relate to clothing or gear needed for hiking. A cast iron stomach, physical exertion, shin splints, adventure, and fatigue are all aspects or consequences of hiking, but they do not address the specific question of what to wear. Therefore, the answer is not explicitly provided in the options given. However, common items to wear when hiking include appropriate footwear, moisture-wicking clothing, layers for temperature control, a hat, and sunscreen. So, the answer would be to wear appropriate hiking attire.\nAnswer: Not explicitly provided in the options.####",

    "expected_answer": "E. upwards",
    "response": "This question is about the direction James looked in as he watched the balloon rise. Since James was below the balloon and watching it rise, he would have looked in the direction opposite to the balloon's movement. The most fitting direction in this context is upwards, as it describes the direction of the balloon's movement away from James. Therefore, the answer is upwards.\nAnswer: E. upwards",

Third, while potatoes are commonly used in restaurants and may be a staple in some cuisines, they are not typically designated as the official vegetable of all restaurants.
