commonsenseqa,mmr,commonsenseqa_dev_951,"Working on the elaborate task was taxing, it require extreme what?
A. holding
B. concentration
C. energy
D. job
E. energh",B. concentration,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

""Working on the elaborate task was taxing, it require extreme what?""

The key clues are:
- The task was ""taxing,"" meaning it was demanding or exhausting.
- The phrase ""require extreme"" suggests we are looking for a quality or resource that can be in high demand during difficult or demanding work.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

A. holding — This doesn't fit well because ""holding"" isn't typically described as something you require in an extreme sense for a taxing task.

B. concentration — Concentration is often needed for complex or demanding tasks, especially elaborate ones. When a task is taxing, it often requires intense focus.

C. energy — Energy is also a good candidate because demanding tasks require physical or mental energy.

D. job — ""Job"" is a noun referring to work, but it doesn't fit the phrase ""require extreme what"" in this context.

E. energh — This appears to be a typo or misspelling of ""energy.""

Between ""concentration"" and ""energy,"" both are plausible. However, ""extreme concentration"" is a common phrase used to describe intense focus needed for difficult tasks, especially elaborate ones.

Therefore, the best fit is:

**B. concentration**

---

**Final reasoning:** Since the task is taxing and elaborate, it demands a high level of mental focus, i.e., concentration.

**Final answer: B. concentration**

A. newness
B. loss of innocence
C. enlightenment
D. open mind
E. smartness",D. open mind,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

**Question:** When learning about the world and different cultures, what is important if you are committed to eliminating preconceived notions?

**Step 1:** Understand the key idea.  
The question emphasizes the importance of eliminating preconceived notions, which are biases or assumptions we might hold before truly understanding something.

**Step 2:** Consider the options:  
A. newness — suggests freshness or novelty, but not directly related to eliminating biases.  
B. loss of innocence — implies a change in purity or naivety, but not specifically about open-mindedness.  
C. enlightenment — refers to gaining insight or understanding, but not necessarily about openness to new ideas.  
D. open mind — directly relates to being receptive to new ideas and eliminating biases.  
E. smartness — indicates intelligence, but doesn't specifically address the attitude needed to eliminate preconceived notions.

**Step 3:** Match the concept with the options.  
The phrase ""eliminating preconceived notions"" aligns most closely with having an **open mind**, which involves being receptive, non-judgmental, and willing to see things from different perspectives.

**Conclusion:**  
The best choice is **D. open mind**.

commonsenseqa,mmr,commonsenseqa_dev_1141,"What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?
A. die
B. interruption
C. bleed
D. hatred
E. dying",B. interruption,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

**Question:** What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?

**Options:**
A. die  
B. interruption  
C. bleed  
D. hatred  
E. dying

**Step 1: Understand the question.**  
The question asks about what could happen if a suicide attempt is not successful. In other words, what is a possible outcome when someone tries to end their life but does not succeed?

**Step 2: Consider each option.**  
- **A. die:** If the attempt is unsuccessful, the person does not die. So this is unlikely.
- **B. interruption:** If the attempt is unsuccessful, it could be interrupted, preventing death. This seems plausible.
- **C. bleed:** Bleeding might occur during a suicide attempt, but bleeding alone doesn't necessarily mean success or failure. It could be part of the attempt, but not specifically indicating failure.
- **D. hatred:** Hatred is an emotion, not a direct result of an attempt.
- **E. dying:** Similar to ""die,"" if the attempt is unsuccessful, the person does not die.

**Step 3: Focus on the meaning of ""unsuccessful.""**  
An unsuccessful attempt implies the person did not achieve their goal—i.e., did not die. The most logical outcome of an unsuccessful attempt is that it was stopped or interrupted before death.

**Step 4: Choose the best answer.**  
""Interruption"" directly indicates that the attempt was halted, which aligns with an unsuccessful attempt.

**Final reasoning:**  
The best fit is **B. interruption**, as it directly relates to the attempt not succeeding due to some stopping factor.

A. profane
B. halibut
C. damaged
D. common
E. halibut",D. common,"Let's analyze the question carefully.

The scenario: Everybody was crying at the holy site, and the tour guide explained that this was what?

Step 1: Understand the context.
- People crying at a holy site suggests an emotional or significant event, possibly religious or spiritual in nature.

Step 2: Examine the options:
A. profane
B. halibut
C. damaged
D. common
E. halibut (repeated)

Note: There are two options labeled ""halibut,"" which is a type of fish. This seems to be an error or a trick, but since ""halibut"" is repeated, we can ignore the duplicate and focus on the unique options.

Step 3: Interpret each option:
- ""Profane"" means disrespectful or irreverent, which doesn't fit the context of crying at a holy site.
- ""Halibut"" is irrelevant to the context; it is a fish, so unlikely.
- ""Damaged"" could refer to physical damage, but not necessarily related to crying.
- ""Common"" means usual or ordinary, which doesn't explain why everyone is crying.

Step 4: Think about the meaning of the scenario.
- If everyone is crying at a holy site, and the tour guide explains that this is ""common,"" it suggests that such emotional reactions are typical or expected at this site.

Step 5: Conclusion:
- The most logical answer is D. common, as it explains that crying is a usual occurrence at this holy site.

Final reasoning: The tour guide is explaining that the crying is a common occurrence at the holy site.

Final answer: D. common

commonsenseqa,mmr,commonsenseqa_dev_248,"The painter started to edge the room with tape, he always took extra care to make the lines clean and crisp when working with an what?
A. triangle
B. middle
C. corner
D. center
E. interior",E. interior,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

""The painter started to edge the room with tape, he always took extra care to make the lines clean and crisp when working with an what?""

The key clues are:
- The painter is edging the room with tape.
- He wants the lines to be clean and crisp.
- The context involves working with a specific shape or part of the room.

Now, consider each option:

A. triangle — While a triangle is a shape, it doesn't directly relate to the process of edging a room with tape, unless the painter is working on a triangular section, which is unlikely in general room painting.

B. middle — The middle isn't a shape or a specific part that would require edging with tape.

C. corner — When painting a room, corners are critical areas where tape is often used to create clean lines, especially when painting walls and ceilings or different colors.

D. center — Similar to middle, the center isn't a specific area where edging with tape is typically emphasized.

E. interior — This refers to the inside of the room, but it doesn't specify a particular part where edging is crucial.

Given that painters often use tape to create clean lines at corners where two walls meet or where walls meet ceilings, the most logical answer is **corner**.

**Final reasoning:** The painter is working on the edges of the room, and to get clean lines, especially at corners, painters use tape carefully.

**Answer:** C. corner
