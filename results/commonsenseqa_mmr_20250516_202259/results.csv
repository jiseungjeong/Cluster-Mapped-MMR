A. holding
B. concentration
C. energy
D. job
E. energh",B. concentration,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

""Working on the elaborate task was taxing, it require extreme what?""

Step 1: Understand the context
- The task is elaborate and taxing, meaning it is demanding or requires significant effort.

Step 2: Identify the key word
- The phrase ""require extreme"" suggests that the missing word should be something that can be described as needing to be at an extreme level.

Step 3: Review options
A. holding – not typically associated with requiring an extreme level
B. concentration – plausible, as complex tasks often demand intense focus
C. energy – also plausible, as demanding tasks require a lot of energy
D. job – doesn't fit well with ""require extreme""
E. energh – appears to be a typo or misspelling of ""energy""

Step 4: Determine the most fitting answer
- Both ""concentration"" and ""energy"" make sense, but ""concentration"" is more directly related to working on an elaborate task that is taxing. When tasks are complex, they often require extreme concentration.

Step 5: Final choice
- The best fit is ""concentration.""

Final answer: B. concentration

A. newness
B. loss of innocence
C. enlightenment
D. open mind
E. smartness",D. open mind,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

**Question:** When learning about the world and different cultures, what is important if you are committed to eliminating preconceived notions?

**Step 1:** Understand the key parts of the question.
- The focus is on learning about the world and different cultures.
- The goal is to eliminate preconceived notions, which suggests openness and avoiding biases.

**Step 2:** Consider the options:
A. newness – suggests freshness or novelty, but not directly related to eliminating preconceived notions.
B. loss of innocence – implies becoming less naive, but not necessarily about eliminating biases.
C. enlightenment – refers to gaining insight or understanding, but not specifically about openness.
D. open mind – directly relates to being receptive to new ideas and eliminating biases.
E. smartness – general intelligence, not specifically about eliminating preconceived notions.

**Step 3:** Match the options to the goal.
- To eliminate preconceived notions, having an open mind is essential because it allows one to consider new perspectives without bias.

**Step 4:** Conclusion.
- The most appropriate answer is **D. open mind**.

**Final answer:** D. open mind

commonsenseqa,mmr,commonsenseqa_dev_1141,"What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?
A. die
B. interruption
C. bleed
D. hatred
E. dying",B. interruption,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

**Question:** What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?

**Options:**
A. die  
B. interruption  
C. bleed  
D. hatred  
E. dying

**Step 1: Understand the question.**  
The question asks: ""What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?""  
This implies that the outcome is that the attempt did not succeed.

**Step 2: Consider each option in context.**  
- **A. die:** If someone dies, the attempt was successful, not unsuccessful. So this is unlikely.
- **B. interruption:** If the attempt is interrupted, it remains unsuccessful. This makes sense.
- **C. bleed:** Bleeding could be part of an attempt, but bleeding alone doesn't necessarily determine success or failure.
- **D. hatred:** Hatred is an emotion, not a direct outcome of an attempt.
- **E. dying:** Similar to 'die,' if someone dies, the attempt was successful.

**Step 3: Determine the most logical answer.**  
The key is ""unsuccessful attempt,"" which suggests the attempt did not result in death. The most fitting answer is **""interruption""**, as an interruption can prevent the attempt from succeeding.

**Step 4: Final check.**  
- Does ""interruption"" fit? Yes, because if the attempt is interrupted, it remains unsuccessful.
- Are there better options? No, because options A and E imply success, and options C and D are less directly related.

**Final answer:**  
**B. interruption**

- **D. common:** suggests that crying at this site is a usual or normal occurrence.
- **E. halibut:** same as B, likely a typo or repetition.

**Step 3: Identify the most logical answer**

- Crying at a holy site could be a common or expected emotional response, especially if the site is significant or sacred.
- The phrase ""this was what?"" suggests the explanation is a characteristic or nature of the site.

**Question:** The painter started to edge the room with tape, he always took extra care to make the lines clean and crisp when working with an what?

**Options:**
A. triangle  
B. middle  
C. corner  
D. center  
E. interior

**Step 1: Understand the context**  
The painter is edging the room with tape, which is a common painting technique to create clean lines along edges, especially at corners or borders.

**Step 2: Consider the purpose of taping**  
Taping is typically used to protect certain areas and to ensure straight, clean lines. When working with tape, the painter often focuses on edges, especially where two surfaces meet.

**Step 3: Think about the phrase ""working with an""**  
The phrase suggests the object or area the painter is working on that requires careful attention for clean lines.

**Step 4: Match options to the context**  
- A. triangle: a shape, not directly related to painting edges.  
- B. middle: not specific to edges or corners.  
- C. corner: a common area where tape is used to create crisp lines.  
- D. center: less relevant to edging or taping.  
- E. interior: a broad term, not specific to the task of edging.

**Step 5: Logical conclusion**  
The most fitting answer is **""corner""**, because painters often use tape to ensure clean lines at corners, which are tricky to paint freehand and benefit from taping.

**Final reasoning:** The phrase ""working with an corner"" makes sense in the context of taping and edging, as corners are critical points where clean lines are desired.

**Answer:** C. corner
