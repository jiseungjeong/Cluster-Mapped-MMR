A. Gas changes to liquid.
B. Solid changes to gas.
C. Liquid changes to gas.
D. Liquid changes to solid.",A,"Let's analyze the question carefully.

**Question:** When Jake breathes out on a cold day, a cloud is formed. Which change occurs that lets Jake see his breath as a cloud?

**Step 1:** Understand what happens when someone exhales on a cold day.

- When Jake breathes out, he exhales warm, moist air.
- On a cold day, the temperature of the surrounding air is low.
- The warm, moist air from his breath cools rapidly upon contact with the cold air.

**Step 2:** Recall the physical process involved.

- The moisture in the exhaled air condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals, forming a visible cloud.
- This process is called **condensation** (liquid to gas) or **deposition** (gas to solid), depending on the temperature and humidity.

**Step 3:** Determine which change corresponds to the formation of the visible cloud.

- Since the warm, moist air cools down and the water vapor condenses into tiny droplets, the key process is **liquid changing to gas** or **gas changing to liquid**.

- In this case, the moisture in the exhaled breath (initially water vapor, a gas) cools and condenses into tiny liquid water droplets, which are visible as a cloud.

**Step 4:** Match the process to the options.

- **A. Gas changes to liquid.** — This describes condensation, which is what happens here.
- **B. Solid changes to gas.** — Sublimation, not relevant here.
- **C. Liquid changes to gas.** — Evaporation or boiling, opposite of what occurs.
- **D. Liquid changes to solid.** — Freezing, not relevant here.

**Conclusion:** The process that allows Jake to see his breath as a cloud is **gas changing to liquid**.

3. a 20-kg object accelerating at 4 m/s^2
4. a 20-kg object accelerating at 3 m/s^2",2,"Let's analyze each option using the formula:  
**Force = mass × acceleration**

**Option 1:**  
Mass = 5 kg  
Acceleration = 10 m/s²  
Force = 5 × 10 = 50 N

**Option 2:**  
Mass = 5 kg  
Acceleration = 20 m/s²  
Force = 5 × 20 = 100 N

**Option 3:**  
Mass = 20 kg  
Acceleration = 4 m/s²  
Force = 20 × 4 = 80 N

**Option 4:**  
Mass = 20 kg  
Acceleration = 3 m/s²  
Force = 20 × 3 = 60 N

Now, compare the forces:  
- Option 1: 50 N  
- Option 2: 100 N  
- Option 3: 80 N  
- Option 4: 60 N

The greatest force is **100 N**, which occurs in **Option 2**.

The question asks: ""What are genes composed of?""

Step 1: Recall what genes are. Genes are units of heredity that carry information about traits.

Step 2: Consider the options:
1. Offspring – This refers to the children or descendants, not what genes are made of.
2. DNA – Genes are segments of DNA that contain genetic information.
3. Cells – Genes are located within cells, but they are not composed of cells.
4. Traits – Traits are characteristics influenced by genes, but they are not what genes are made of.

Step 3: The key point is that genes are made of DNA, which is the molecule that carries genetic instructions.

Final reasoning: Since genes are segments of DNA, the correct answer is DNA.

Step 1: Understand what measuring the boiling point involves.
- The boiling point is the temperature at which water changes from liquid to gas.
- To find this temperature, we need a tool that measures temperature accurately.

Step 2: Review the options:
A. hot plate and stopwatch
- Hot plate can heat water, but a stopwatch measures time, not temperature.
- Not suitable for measuring boiling point directly.

B. thermometer and balance
- Thermometer measures temperature, which is necessary.
- Balance measures mass, not temperature.
- Not ideal for determining boiling point.

C. hot plate and thermometer
- Hot plate heats the water.
- Thermometer measures the temperature of the water.
- This combination allows us to heat water and measure its temperature as it boils, making it suitable for determining boiling point.

D. balance and graduated cylinder
- Balance measures mass.
- Graduated cylinder measures volume.
- Neither measures temperature; thus, not suitable for boiling point measurement.

Step 3: Conclusion:
The best tools for determining the boiling point are those that can both heat the water and measure its temperature accurately. That is option C: hot plate and thermometer.

A. Fat makes the polar bear large.
B. Fat makes the polar bear slippery.
C. Fat helps the polar bear run on ice.
D. Fat helps the polar bear float in water.",D,"Let's analyze the question carefully. It states that about half of a polar bear's mass is fat and asks how this adaptation helps the polar bear as it hunts in the Arctic Ocean.

- The key point is understanding the role of fat in a polar bear's survival and hunting.

- Fat is less dense than water, which means it provides buoyancy, helping the bear float.

- Being able to float is advantageous for hunting in the Arctic Ocean, as it allows the bear to swim efficiently and stay afloat while searching for prey.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

A. Fat makes the polar bear large.  
- While fat does contribute to the overall size, the primary benefit related to hunting in water is not just size but buoyancy.

B. Fat makes the polar bear slippery.  
- Fat does not necessarily make the bear slippery; this is not a primary adaptation for hunting.

C. Fat helps the polar bear run on ice.  
- Fat may provide some insulation and cushioning, but it is not primarily for running on ice.

D. Fat helps the polar bear float in water.  
- This directly relates to buoyancy, which is crucial for swimming and hunting in the Arctic Ocean.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is D.

Final reasoning: The fat in polar bears provides buoyancy, helping them float in water, which is essential for their hunting strategy in the Arctic Ocean.

A. Nitrogen replaces oxygen in the water.
B. The temperature of the water increases.
C. Wave action carries away the dead algae.
D. Bottom dwellers die and fish swim away.",D,"Let's analyze the scenario carefully:

- Nutrient-laden waters cause an algae bloom.
- When the algae decay, they consume large amounts of oxygen.
- The depletion of oxygen in the water can lead to hypoxic conditions, which are harmful to aquatic life.

Now, consider each option:

A. Nitrogen replaces oxygen in the water.
- While nitrogen is a nutrient involved in algae blooms, it doesn't ""replace"" oxygen directly. The key issue is oxygen depletion, not nitrogen replacing it.

B. The temperature of the water increases.
- Decay of algae can produce some heat, but the primary concern here is oxygen depletion, not temperature increase.

C. Wave action carries away the dead algae.
- Wave action can disperse algae, but this doesn't address the main problem of oxygen depletion affecting marine life.

D. Bottom dwellers die and fish swim away.
- As oxygen levels drop, especially near the bottom where decay occurs, many aquatic organisms, including bottom dwellers and fish, are likely to die or leave the area to escape hypoxic conditions.

Therefore, the most logical consequence of oxygen depletion due to algae decay is that aquatic life, particularly bottom dwellers and fish, would die or move away.

Final reasoning: The decay of algae consumes oxygen, leading to hypoxia, which causes marine organisms to die or flee.

**Answer: D. Bottom dwellers die and fish swim away.**
