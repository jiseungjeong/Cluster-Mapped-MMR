A. holding
B. concentration
C. energy
D. job
E. energh",B. concentration,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

""Working on the elaborate task was taxing, it require extreme what?""

Step 1: Understand the context
- The task is elaborate and taxing, meaning it is demanding or requires a lot of mental or physical effort.

Step 2: Identify the options
A. holding
B. concentration
C. energy
D. job
E. energh (likely a typo for ""energy"")

Step 3: Consider which word best fits the context
- Since the task is taxing and elaborate, it likely requires a high level of mental focus or physical effort.
- ""Concentration"" fits well because an elaborate task demanding focus would require extreme concentration.
- ""Energy"" also makes sense because demanding tasks often require a lot of energy.

Step 4: Determine the most appropriate answer
- Between ""concentration"" and ""energy,"" both are plausible.
- However, ""concentration"" specifically relates to mental effort, which is often emphasized in elaborate tasks.
- ""Energy"" is more general, but since the question emphasizes ""extreme,"" ""concentration"" seems more precise for a taxing mental task.

Step 5: Final choice
- The best fit is ""concentration.""

Final answer: B. concentration

A. newness
B. loss of innocence
C. enlightenment
D. open mind
E. smartness",D. open mind,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

**Question:** When learning about the world and different cultures, what is important if you are committed to eliminating preconceived notions?

**Step 1:** Understand the key parts of the question.
- The focus is on learning about the world and different cultures.
- The goal is to eliminate preconceived notions, which suggests openness and avoiding biases.

**Step 2:** Consider the options:
A. newness – suggests freshness or novelty, but not directly related to eliminating preconceived notions.
B. loss of innocence – implies becoming less naive, but not necessarily about eliminating biases.
C. enlightenment – refers to gaining insight or understanding, but not specifically about openness.
D. open mind – directly relates to being receptive to new ideas and eliminating biases.
E. smartness – general intelligence, not specifically about eliminating preconceived notions.

**Step 3:** Match the options to the goal.
- To eliminate preconceived notions, having an open mind is essential because it allows one to consider new perspectives without bias.

**Step 4:** Conclusion.
- The most appropriate answer is **D. open mind**.

**Final answer:** D. open mind

commonsenseqa,mmr,commonsenseqa_dev_1141,"What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?
A. die
B. interruption
C. bleed
D. hatred
E. dying",B. interruption,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

**Question:** What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?

**Options:**
A. die  
B. interruption  
C. bleed  
D. hatred  
E. dying

**Step 1: Understand the question.**  
The question asks: ""What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?""  
This implies that the outcome is that the attempt did not succeed.

**Step 2: Consider each option in context.**  
- **A. die:** If someone dies, the attempt was successful, not unsuccessful. So this is unlikely.  
- **B. interruption:** If the attempt is interrupted, it remains unsuccessful. This seems plausible.  
- **C. bleed:** Bleeding could be part of an attempt, but bleeding alone doesn't necessarily determine success or failure.  
- **D. hatred:** Hatred is an emotion, not a direct result of an attempt. It doesn't fit well.  
- **E. dying:** Similar to 'die,' if someone is dying, the attempt was successful.

**Step 3: Narrow down the options.**  
The key is ""unsuccessful attempt,"" meaning the person did not succeed in ending their life. The most logical answer is **interruption**, as an external factor stopping the attempt would make it unsuccessful.

**Step 4: Confirm reasoning.**  
- An unsuccessful attempt is often due to external factors or intervention, which aligns with ""interruption.""  
- The other options imply success or are unrelated.

**Final conclusion:**  
The best answer is **B. interruption**.

**Question:** Everybody seemed to be crying at the holy site, the tour guide explained that this was what?

**Options:**
A. profane  
B. halibut  
C. damaged  
D. common  
E. halibut

---

**Step 1: Understand the context**

- The scene involves a holy site where everyone is crying.
- The tour guide explains that this crying is ""what?"" — implying a reason or explanation for the crying.

---

**Step 2: Examine the options**

- **A. profane:** means disrespectful or irreverent, which doesn't directly relate to crying at a holy site.
- **B. halibut:** a type of fish, which seems unrelated.
- **C. damaged:** could refer to something broken, but doesn't directly explain crying.
- **D. common:** suggests that crying is a usual or normal occurrence at this site.
- **E. halibut:** same as B, likely a distractor.

Note: ""halibut"" appears twice, which suggests it's a distractor or a trick option.

---

**Step 3: Consider the most logical answer**

- Since many people are crying at a holy site, and the tour guide explains that this is ""common,"" it makes sense that crying could be a common or typical reaction at this location.

- The other options don't fit well:
  - ""Profane"" doesn't explain crying.
  - ""Damaged"" doesn't relate to crying.
  - ""Halibut"" is irrelevant.

**Therefore, the most logical and contextually fitting answer is ""common.""**

---

**Final step: Confirm reasoning**

- The phrase ""this was what?"" suggests an explanation for the crying.
- ""Common"" fits as an explanation that crying is a usual occurrence at this site.

E. interior",E. interior,"Let's analyze the question carefully:

**Question:** The painter started to edge the room with tape, he always took extra care to make the lines clean and crisp when working with an what?

**Step 1: Understand the context**

- The painter is using tape to create clean, crisp lines along the edges of a room.
- The key phrase is ""edge the room with tape"" and ""make the lines clean and crisp.""

**Step 2: Identify the object or area involved**

- When painters tape is used, it is typically applied along edges or corners to ensure straight lines when painting.
- The phrase ""working with an"" suggests the object or area the painter is working on or with.

**Step 3: Consider the options**

A. triangle  
B. middle  
C. corner  
D. center  
E. interior

- ""Triangle"" is unlikely; painters don't typically work with a triangle in this context.
- ""Middle"" and ""center"" are less relevant; the focus is on edges and lines.
- ""Interior"" is a broad term; while relevant to rooms, it doesn't specify the part where tape is applied.
- ""Corner"" is a common area where painters use tape to ensure clean lines, especially when painting walls or ceilings.

**Step 4: Logical reasoning**

- When edging a room, painters often tape along corners to prevent paint from bleeding onto adjacent surfaces.
- They take extra care to make the lines clean and crisp at corners.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

The most logical and contextually appropriate answer is **""corner""** because that's where painters often use tape to achieve clean lines.

**Final answer:** D. corner
