    "expected_answer": "B. concentration",
    "response": "This question is about the demanding nature of a task and what it requires. The use of the word \"taxing\" suggests that the task is mentally or physically challenging. The word \"elaborate\" also implies that the task is complex and detailed. Given these clues, the most likely requirement for working on such a task is concentration, as it would demand focus and attention to detail. Holding, energy, and job are not directly related to the mental effort needed for an elaborate task. Therefore, the answer is concentration.\nAnswer: B. concentration\n\n#### B. concentration",

The term \"profane\" refers to something that is not sacred or religious, so it does not fit the context of people crying at a holy site. \"Halibut\" is a type of fish and does not make sense in this context. \"Damaged\" and \"common\" do not align with the typical emotional response at a holy site.

    "response": "This question is about identifying the purpose or target of the guard's presence. The first thought process is that a guard is typically stationed to protect or monitor a specific location or individual, such as a man post. The second thought process is that a guard may be present to prevent or respond to an attack, but this does not specify who the guard is guarding. The third thought process is that intimidation is a tactic a guard may use, but it does not clarify who the guard is protecting. The fourth thought process is that a guard may be responsible for overseeing or securing a prisoner, making this a possible target. The fifth thought process is that being unprotected is the opposite of what a guard aims to achieve. Therefore, the answer is D. prisoner.\nAnswer: D. prisoner",

Among the options, a pet store is the most common and likely place to find snakes kept in cages for sale or display. The other options, such as tropical forest, Oregon, woods, and Louisiana, are not typical places where snakes are kept in cages. Therefore, the answer is D. pet store.\nAnswer: D. pet store",

    "expected_answer": "E. teach courses",
    "response": "This question is about the primary role of professors in academia. While professors may have expertise in specific subjects like physics, their primary role is to teach and educate students. Professors are known for teaching courses, guiding students in their learning, and conducting research in their field. The other options, such as mastering physics, stating facts, wearing wrinkled tweed jackets, and schooling students, do not capture the main function of professors. Therefore, the answer is E. teach courses.\nAnswer: E. teach courses",

    "expected_answer": "B. front door",
    "response": "This question is about the typical location of a doormat. The first thought process is that a doormat is usually placed in front of an entrance to a building or a room. The second thought process is that options like \"facade\" and \"hallway\" are not specific locations where a doormat would typically be placed. The third thought process is that \"front door,\" \"doorway,\" and \"entrance porch\" are all locations where a doormat is commonly found, but the most specific and common location is in front of the front door. Therefore, the answer is B. front door.\nAnswer: B. front door",
