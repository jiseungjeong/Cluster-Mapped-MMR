A. Gas changes to liquid.
B. Solid changes to gas.
C. Liquid changes to gas.
D. Liquid changes to solid.",A,"Let's analyze the process step-by-step:

1. When Jake exhales, he releases warm, moist air into the cold environment.
2. The warm, moist air contains water vapor in gaseous form.
3. On a cold day, the temperature of the surrounding air is low enough that the water vapor cools rapidly.
4. As the water vapor cools, it condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals, forming a visible cloud or ""breath.""

Now, considering the options:

A. Gas changes to liquid.  
- This describes condensation, which is what happens when water vapor cools and turns into tiny liquid droplets.  
- This matches the process of forming Jake's breath cloud.

B. Solid changes to gas.  
- This describes sublimation or vaporization, which is not relevant here.  
- The water vapor is condensing, not sublimating.

C. Liquid changes to gas.  
- This describes evaporation or boiling, which is the opposite process of condensation.  
- Not what occurs when Jake's breath forms a cloud.

D. Liquid changes to solid.  
- This describes freezing, which is not happening in this scenario.

**Conclusion:** The process that allows Jake to see his breath as a cloud is the condensation of water vapor into tiny liquid droplets.

**Final answer:** A

3. a 20-kg object accelerating at 4 m/s^2
4. a 20-kg object accelerating at 3 m/s^2",2,"Let's analyze each option using the formula:  
**Force = mass × acceleration**

**Option 1:**  
Mass = 5 kg  
Acceleration = 10 m/s²  
Force = 5 × 10 = 50 N

**Option 2:**  
Mass = 5 kg  
Acceleration = 20 m/s²  
Force = 5 × 20 = 100 N

**Option 3:**  
Mass = 20 kg  
Acceleration = 4 m/s²  
Force = 20 × 4 = 80 N

**Option 4:**  
Mass = 20 kg  
Acceleration = 3 m/s²  
Force = 20 × 3 = 60 N

- Option 1: 50 N  
- Option 2: 100 N  
- Option 3: 80 N

1. offspring

The question asks: ""What are genes composed of?""

We are given options:
1. offspring
2. DNA
3. cells
4. traits

**Step 1: Recall what genes are.**  
Genes are units of heredity that carry information from parent to offspring. They are segments of DNA that encode instructions for building proteins.

**Step 2: Determine which option correctly describes the composition of genes.**  
- Offspring: Not correct; offspring are organisms, not what genes are made of.  
- DNA: Correct; genes are made of DNA sequences.  
- Cells: Not correct; cells contain genes, but genes themselves are segments of DNA, not cells.  
- Traits: Not correct; traits are characteristics expressed by genes, but traits are not what genes are composed of.

**Step 3: Confirm the correct answer.**  
Since genes are segments of DNA, the best choice is option 2.

**Final answer:** 2

**Question 1:** The body is able to detect pressure on its surface by which direct means?

- **Option A:** Releasing hormones in skin — Hormones are chemical messengers, but they are not directly involved in sensing pressure.
- **Option B:** Changing in volume of fat and muscle cells — Changes in volume are not the primary means of pressure detection.
- **Option C:** Signaling by sensory neurons — Sensory neurons, specifically mechanoreceptors, detect pressure and convert it into electrical signals.
- **Option D:** Changing of voltage in interneurons — Interneurons process signals but are not directly responsible for sensing pressure.

**Conclusion:** The most direct means of detecting pressure is through sensory neurons that respond to mechanical stimuli.

**Final answer:** **C**

**Question 2:** Which of these do scientists offer as the most recent explanation as to why many plants and animals died out at the end of the Mesozoic era?

- **Option A:** Worldwide disease — While diseases can cause extinctions, current evidence points to a different cause.
- **Option B:** Global mountain building — Mountain building affects climate but is not the primary explanation for the mass extinction.
- **Option C:** Rise of mammals that preyed upon plants and animals — Predation pressure is a factor but not the main cause of the mass extinction.
- **Option D:** Impact of an asteroid created dust that blocked the sunlight — Scientific evidence supports the asteroid impact hypothesis, which caused a ""nuclear winter"" effect, blocking sunlight and disrupting ecosystems.

**Conclusion:** The most widely accepted recent explanation is the asteroid impact.

**Final answer:** **D**

A. predation
B. parasitism
C. mutualism
D. commensalism",B,"Let's analyze the relationship described: bass tapeworms attach to the gills and intestines of bass fish and take nutrients from the bass. This indicates that the tapeworm benefits by gaining nutrients, while the bass is harmed because it loses nutrients or suffers health issues.

Now, consider the options:

- **Predation**: This involves one organism hunting and killing another. Since the tapeworm does not kill the fish directly but harms it by taking nutrients, this is not predation.

- **Parasitism**: This is a relationship where one organism benefits at the expense of the other, often harming it. The tapeworm benefits, and the fish is harmed, fitting parasitism.

- **Mutualism**: Both organisms benefit. This is not the case here, as the fish is harmed.

- **Commensalism**: One benefits, and the other is unaffected. Since the fish is harmed, this is not commensalism.

Therefore, the relationship is **parasitism**.
